# Learning about Version Control

**Author:** Fazeeia Mohammed

Welcome to my project on learning about version control! In this repository, I will explore the basics of version control systems (VCS), specifically Git. The goal is to understand the benefits of using version control, such as tracking changes in code, collaborating with other developers, and managing different versions of a project.


## Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!
## What I Like About Version Control
I really like how version control lets me track changes over time and easily collaborate with other developers. 

## Challenges with Version Control
Sometimes, resolving merge conflicts can be confusing and time-consuming, especially when multiple people are working on the same parts of the code. It is so time consuming I am hungry.
